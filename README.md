## This is my OTF theme, version 3.2, new and improved, lookin sexy.

So if you'd like to rep OTF in this way, feel free to download the css &/or paste the code into ur custom editor.

# How to use:
This is for those who aren't familiar with better discord, themes, or plugins.
First off download [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app/), make sure you install it into the correct discord app.
Next, after launching BetterDiscord, assuming it installed correctly.. You're gonna want some plugins in which are crucial and to be honest you're gonna want and are extremely useful. So go to [my favorite plugins](https://github.com/Svxy/My-Favorite-Plugins/tree/main/Cutieys%20Favorite%20Plugins/Plugins) on github and make sure you download all of them, just because i dont know if any of these are acting as dependencies for my theme.

After that, go to your settings and find "Plugins" in the betterdiscord category, and you're gonna want to enable the following..

[PluginRepo](https://github.com/Svxy/My-Favorite-Plugins/blob/main/Cutieys%20Favorite%20Plugins/Plugins/PluginRepo.plugin.js),
[DiscordExperiments](https://github.com/Svxy/My-Favorite-Plugins/blob/main/Cutieys%20Favorite%20Plugins/Plugins/discordexperiments.plugin.js),
[ThemeRepo](https://github.com/Svxy/My-Favorite-Plugins/blob/main/Cutieys%20Favorite%20Plugins/Plugins/ThemeRepo.plugin.js),
[ThemeSettings](https://github.com/Svxy/My-Favorite-Plugins/tree/main/Cutieys%20Favorite%20Plugins/Plugins),
[XenoLib](https://github.com/Svxy/My-Favorite-Plugins/blob/main/Cutieys%20Favorite%20Plugins/Plugins/1XenoLib.plugin.js),
and [ZeresPluginLibrary](https://github.com/Svxy/My-Favorite-Plugins/tree/main/Cutieys%20Favorite%20Plugins/Plugins).

Next after you've enabled those and whichever other plugins you want, click on the "Custom CSS" tab and paste the code from [my CSS](https://github.com/Svxy/CutieysOTFTheme/blob/main/OTFThemeV3.2.css).

### Enjoy! :)
